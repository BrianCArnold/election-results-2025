DRAFT ONLY: DO NOT SIGN THIS YET
================================

This petition is in **draft form only**.  Please do not sign this yet.
We started drafting this as a private group of small individuals, but we
decided to move to a transparent method ourselves and it's here, but
it's not ready to sign (even though there are actually pending sign
merge request, we will get back to those folks when we're ready).

Please propose edits to the following document. My primary concern is to see it formatted (summary / bullet lists / bold-thesis-sentences… all those things that make it
easier to skim and to process, that remove the wall-of-text feeling).

# Petition to the Open Source Initiative: Publish the Full 2025 Election Results

**We, the undersigned, petition the Open Source Initiative
(OSI) to release the complete, unaltered results of its 2025 Board of
Directors elections**. We believe OSI's mishandling of the election,
specifically altering the rules and results after voting concluded, has damaged
its credibility and requires immediate transparency.

**OSI relies *entirely* on community deference and respect**
for its authority in promoting Open Source and the
consistent use of the term "Open Source."

- Since 2012, OSI has relied on elections by individual and affiliate
  members to draw in community and build a capable board.
- Though advisory in strict legal terms, elections have been vital to
  OSI's community focus and standing.
- Historically, OSI has worked toward following best practices and honored election results—until now.

## What Went Wrong

**In 2025, OSI altered the election results by removing three candidates and all votes cast for them.**
The elections were conducted using the OpaVote service, which emails each
voter a unique ballot link. Examples:

- [Unmarked ballot](https://codeberg.org/OSI-Concerns/election-results-2025/src/branch/main/osi-2025-unmarked-ballot-example.png)
- [Filled-in ballot](https://codeberg.org/OSI-Concerns/election-results-2025/src/branch/main/osi-2025-marked-ballot-example.png)

OpaVote allows results to be published directly
to participants. Instead of using this built-in transparency feature,
OSI downloaded the ballot data, removed three candidates, altered voting
preference numbers for remaining candidates, and [published the altered
voting results.]((https://opensource.org/blog/announcing-the-new-directors-of-osi-board))

**OSI justified its intervention by citing a new requirement: that candidates sign a board agreement.**
However, this requirement was introduced *after* voting had concluded
but *before* the results were announced. The three excluded
candidates—Richard Fontana (a former OSI director), Bradley Kuhn, and
Bentley Hensel—were not named in OSI’s announcement, but their removal
was evident from the published data.

Fontana and Kuhn's platform aimed for significant changes to OSI. In a
seemingly smaller change, it sought to revise a clause in the board
agreement requiring directors “support publicly all Board decisions,”
which they viewed as overly broad. In previous years, there was a
possibility for candidates to discuss such agreements with the board
after being elected. In 2025, that opportunity was eliminated by the
sudden imposition of a post-voting deadline. Hensel, by contrast,
appears to have simply missed the short window to respond.

 [*LWN* OSI election
coverage](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1014603/ac0cfc0a74755501/)
noted that "A cynical person might conclude that the last-minute
requirement to sign the agreement was to disqualify one or both because
they would have won otherwise; and that the OSI leadership was unwilling
to have even a minority number of board members who might seek to steer
the ship in a different direction."

We do not endorse any particular candidates or policy positions, but we
acknowledge these serious concerns.

## Why This Matters

**Changing election rules mid-process and altering vote counts undermines the integrity of any election.**
Results must be published transparently—regardless
of whether a candidate withdraws, dies, or is disqualified for any
reason. Once a candidate has been placed on the ballot, the only way to
respect the voting electorate is to count and report the votes as
marked. A trustworthy election cannot have rules changed during the
election process.

**By adding requirements *during* an election process and altering
votes, OSI has damaged its credibility.** Any tampering with elections
erodes community trust. Note that this concern is not a legal one. Even
tampering with informal polls on a forum can severely harm an
organization's reputation.

**Election results with candidates removed are not valid.**
Voter behavior is shaped by the full candidate list. Removing candidates after voting distorts the outcome:

- Voters often devalue lower preferences based on strategic calculations.
- Preference-based voting systems support different valid voting strategies.
- A different candidate pool might have changed who ran or how people voted.

## Conclusion

We are community members who care about OSI's mission and its standing
in the world. We wish to see OSI thrive in good standing.

**To restore its credibility, we call on OSI to:**

- Release the unaltered election totals.
- Acknowledge the harmful impact of this situation.
- Credibly recommit to working with the community on all steps necessary to repair lost trust.
