# Petition to the Open Source Initiative: Publish the Full 2025 Election Results

**We, the undersigned, petition the Open Source Initiative
(OSI) to release the complete, unaltered results of its 2025 Board of
Directors elections**. We believe that by removing candidates and votes
*after* voting concluded, OSI has damaged its credibility.
We call for transparency as a first step toward repairing
OSI's integrity and reputation.

## Background context

**OSI relies *entirely* on community deference and respect**
for its authority in promoting Open Source and the
consistent use of the term "Open Source."

- Since 2012, when OSI began operating as a member-driven organization,
  individual and affiliate members have voted in elections for OSI Directors.
- Although OSI is not legally bound to accept the results,
  the elections have been a key part of community and membership engagement,
  and OSI has always worked to follow best practices for public elections.
- Until 2025, OSI has published the full results of elections.

## 2025 election

**In 2025, OSI excluded all votes for three candidates before publishing results.**
The announcement of the 
[altered voting results]((https://opensource.org/blog/announcing-the-new-directors-of-osi-board))
did not name the removed candidates, but they were Richard Fontana
(a former OSI director), Bradley Kuhn, and Bentley Hensel.

Notably, Fontana and Kuhn campaigned on a joint
[OSI Reform platform](https://codeberg.org/OSI-Reform-Platform/platform#readme)
which included four proposals, the most significant being a call to repeal the
the newly-adopted Open Source AI Definition (OSAID).
They also advocated for revising the
[OSI Board Member Agreement](https://opensource.org/board/board-member-agreement),
because they interpreted the clause requiring members to "support publicly all Board
decisions" as being overly expansive and stifling. They proposed clarifying or
limiting the clause to achieve a better balance.

Normally, as in prior years, as with other organizations, and as stated during
candidate orientation, signing of the Board Agreement would happen only
with the election winners as part of getting seated as new Directors.
Fontana and Kuhn stated their good-faith intentions to bring up their concerns
about the agreement if and when they won the election.

Then, **about one hour after voting ended, OSI emailed a *new* requirement
to the 11 non-incumbent candidates. They gave a 47-hour deadline for all to
sign the Board Agreement or be disqualified.**

Hensel missed the deadline simply by not checking his email soon enough
(being quite busy running for US Congress as well).
Fontana and Kuhn returned signed agreements with their proposed changes.
OSI removed them all as "ineligible" and published only an altered
vote tally after manually removing all votes for the three eliminated candidates.

## Ramifications

In general, changing election rules mid-process and altering vote counts
undermines the integrity of any election.
Results must be published transparentlyâ€”regardless of whether a
candidate withdraws, dies, or is disqualified for any reason. Once a
candidate appears on the ballot, the only way to respect voters is to
count and report the votes as cast.

Regardless of the particular concerns about the Board Agreement, for the
current OSI Board to have eliminated critical candidates while hiding
the voting results sets up a situation where the community is liable
to speculate about motives, conflicts of interest, and more.

[*LWN* OSI election coverage](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1014603/ac0cfc0a74755501/)
noted that "A cynical person might conclude that the last-minute
requirement to sign the agreement was to disqualify one or both because
they would have won otherwise; and that the OSI leadership was unwilling
to have even a minority number of board members who might seek to steer
the ship in a different direction."

## Call for resolution

As community members who care about OSI's mission and its standing
in the world, we wish to see OSI thrive in good standing.
We do not endorse particular candidates or policy positions.
We believe that everyone should care about transparency regardless
of whether we are supportive, critical, or neutral on the policy
concerns brought up in the election.

**To restore credibility and integrity, we call on OSI to:**

- Publish the full, unaltered election results.
- Acknowledge the harm caused by this situation.
- Credibly recommit to working with the community on all steps necessary to repair lost trust.
