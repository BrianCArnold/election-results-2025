Petition to Open Source Initiative To Publish 2025 Board of Directors Election Results
======================================================================================

in the interest of community trust and transparency of process, we the
undersigned petition the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to release the
anonymized ballot data for OSI's 2025 Board of Directors election —
including votes for all candidates who received any nomination.

The basis for our petition is that three candidates’ votes were not counted.
OSI states these candidates failed to follow a qualification procedure.
Multiple candidates have confirmed that they were informed of this
qualification procedure only after voting closed.

OSI's announcement at
https://opensource.org/blog/announcing-the-new-directors-of-osi-board
indicates these three candidates were removed from those already-cast ballots
before vote tabulation. (Please also see
https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1014603/ac0cfc0a74755501/ for relevant press
coverage of this election.)

We are grateful for OSI's advisory election process. While only advisory,
the process includes community and builds trust with Affiliates and
Members. To retain that trust, the process must operate transparently and
respect the electorates. OSI's credibility is at risk if it violates its
mission — which includes “distributed peer review and transparency of
process” (as well as consensus building and good governance). Therefore, OSI
should candidly report the full voting results (by release of the anonymized
ballot data) and honestly and directly, rather than obliquely, describe the
differences between the election results and the actual Board appointments.

This is an open petition that was original prepared by the original signers below.

We then posted this on Codeberg, and new signers can submit their signature
with a merge request. We encourage anyone who agrees with the petition to do
so. If you have a relationship with OSI (e.g., a Member, Former Director,
etc.), pease indicate your relationship to OSI in your signature.

We ask that OSI Affiliates have their Affiliate Representative sign on behalf
of the organization; they and other Affiliate employees/volunteers can of
course sign separtely on their own behalf, too.

Respectfully,
