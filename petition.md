DRAFT ONLY: DO NOT SIGN THIS YET
================================

This petition is in **draft form only**.  Please do not sign this yet.
We started drafting this as a private group of small individuals, but we
decided to move to a transparent method ourselves and it's here, but
it's not ready to sign (even though there are actually pending sign
merge request, we will get back to those folks when we're ready).

Petition to Open Source Initiative to Publish 2025 Board of Directors Election Results
================================================================

We the undersigned petition the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to release
the complete and accurate results of its 2025 Board of Directors
Individual and Affiliate elections.  We call for this transparency out
of concern that OSI's mishandling of its recent elections has damaged
the organization's credibility and reputation.

OSI relies *entirely* on community deference and respect in order to
retain its role as an authority that promotes Open Source and the
consistent use of the term "Open Source".  So, it is of utmost
importance that OSI repair its integrity with its members and the wider
community.

OSI elections have been a key part of its governance since 2012, when it
shifted toward having a board primary elected by individual and
affiliate members. Although only advisory in strict legal terms, these
elections serve OSI's community focus and standing.  For all the past
years, OSI has committed to running elections according to
best-practices, and they have honored the election results.

The 2025 election was run with the OpaVote service.
In that process, OpaVote emails each voter a unique url leading to a
formal ballot which runs some proprietary JavaScript and looks like this:

- [an unmarked ballot](https://codeberg.org/OSI-Concerns/election-results-2025/src/branch/main/osi-2025-unmarked-ballot-example.png)
- [a filled in ballot](https://codeberg.org/OSI-Concerns/election-results-2025/src/branch/main/osi-2025-marked-ballot-example.png)

OpaVote then provides the election manager a function to publish the
results to the voters.  But instead of using that option, it seems OSI
downloaded the ballot data, and then altered the data to remove 3
candidates and all the votes they received. OSI then published the
altered election results. We can infer this process because OpaVote
offers no option to change vote totals before tallying (and presumably
doing so would compromise trust in the integrity of their service). The
altered results are passed off as if they represent a legitimate
election between the remaining candidates but they don't and for many
reasons, an actual race would likely have notably different vote counts.

OSI's
[stated reason for the intervention](https://opensource.org/blog/announcing-the-new-directors-of-osi-board)
is that 3 candidates (who they did not acknowledge by name) failed to
satisfy a requirement to sign the OSI board agreement. But **the
requirement that all candidates sign the agreement was added at the end
of the 2025 election --- *after* all voting had concluded, but *before*
results were announced.**

In the past, as with any other comparable election for any other
organization, signing of the board agreement took place only with the
elected directors after the election.

In any normal election, results are published transparently â€” regardless
of whether some candidates drop out or die or are disqualified for any
reason.  Once a candidate has been placed on the ballot, the only way to
respect the voting electorate is to count and report the votes as
marked. A trustworthy election cannot have rules changed during the
election process, and the voting must be tabulated and reported
accurately.

Any tampering with elections erodes community trust.  Note that this
concern is not a legal one. Even tampering with informal polls on a
forum is the sort of behavior that can severely harm an organization's
reputation.

By adding requirements *during* an election process and
altering votes, OSI has damaged its credibility with the membership and
wider community.

The three candidates removed from the vote tally were Richard Fontana
(incidentally, a former OSI director), Bradley Kuhn, and Bentley
Hensel. Kuhn and Fontana's campaign platform sought various changes to
OSI, including to revise a provision of the OSI board member agreement
to "support publicly all Board decisions," due to concerns that it is
overly broad. The existing process for joining the OSI board would have
included the possibility to discuss the board member agreement with the
OSI board before signing. The newly announced requirement to sign within
a few days after the voting closed excluded that possibility. An
[article at
*LWN*](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1014603/ac0cfc0a74755501/) states
that "a cynical person might conclude that the last-minute requirement
to sign the agreement was to disqualify one or both" and covers more
concerning details around this election. Bentley Hensel on the other
hand was simply busy and didn't respond promptly enough to the sudden
new requirement.

With this petition, we do not endorse any particular candidates or
policy positions.  We are community members who care about OSI's mission
and its standing in the world.  We wish to see OSI thrive in good
standing.

To restore its credibility and reputation, we call on OSI to immediately
release the unaltered election totals, to acknowledge the harms to the
community that this situation has caused, and to credibly recommit to
working with the community on all the steps necessary to repair lost
trust.
